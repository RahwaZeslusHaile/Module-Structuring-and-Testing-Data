// This problem involves playing cards: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck

// You will need to implement a function getCardValue

// You need to write assertions for your function to check it works in different cases

// Acceptance criteria:

// Given a card string in the format "A♠" (representing a card in blackjack - the last character will always be an emoji for a suit, and all characters before will be a number 2-10, or one letter of J, Q, K, A),
// When the function getCardValue is called with this card string as input,
// Then it should return the numerical card value

// Handle Number Cards (2-10):
// Given a card with a rank between "2" and "9",
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should return the numeric value corresponding to the rank (e.g., "5" should return 5).

// Handle Face Cards (J, Q, K):
// Given a card with a rank of "10," "J," "Q," or "K",
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should return the value 10, as these cards are worth 10 points each in blackjack.

// Handle Ace (A):
// Given a card with a rank of "A",
// When the function is called with an Ace,
// Then it should, by default, assume the Ace is worth 11 points, which is a common rule in blackjack.

// Handle Invalid Cards:
// Given a card with an invalid rank (neither a number nor a recognized face card),
// When the function is called with such a card,
// Then it should throw an error indicating "Invalid card rank."


function getCardValue(card) {
    const rank = card.slice(0, -1);
    // to exclude the last character

    // Check for Number Cards (2-10)
    if (!isNaN(rank) && Number(rank) >= 2 && Number(rank) <= 10) {
        return Number(rank);
    }

    // Check for Face Cards (J, Q, K) or '10'
    if (['J', 'Q', 'K'].includes(rank) || rank === '10') {
        return 10;
    }

    // Check for Ace (A)
    if (rank === 'A') {
        return 11;
    }

    
    throw new Error("Invalid card rank.");

console.log(getCardValue("010♠"));  
console.log(getCardValue("02♠"));

console.log(getCardValue("2.1♠"))
